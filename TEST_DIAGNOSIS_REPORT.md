## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Pricing Page Black Screen Issue

**Problem**: The pricing page at `/pricing` may display a black screen with no content visible.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The page component renders correctly in the code (`client/src/pages/pricing.tsx`)
- Background gradient is set to `from-gray-950 via-purple-950 to-pink-950`
- Issue likely related to:
  1. CSS not loading properly
  2. JavaScript bundle errors preventing React rendering
  3. Routing issues in the App.tsx component

**Testing Approach**:
```javascript
// Automated detection in critical-flow-tests.mjs
const backgroundColor = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return window.getComputedStyle(document.body).backgroundColor;
});

const hasVisibleContent = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return document.body.innerText.trim().length > 0;
});
```

### 2. Google OAuth Flow Issues

**Current Implementation** (from `server/google-auth.ts`):
- New users get `needsTrialSelection: true` flag
- After OAuth, users are redirected based on status:
  - Admin → Dashboard (`/`)
  - New user → Trial Selection (`/trial-selection`)
  - Unverified → Email verification
  - Existing user → Dashboard

**Potential Issues**:
1. OAuth middleware might block callbacks
2. State mismatch causing authentication failures
3. Cookie settings preventing JWT storage

### 3. Trial Selection Navigation

**Flow Analysis**:
- Unauthenticated users clicking "Start Free Trial" should go to `/trial-selection`
- The trial selection page should display even for unauthenticated users
- Clicking a trial option should redirect to `/auth` if not logged in

## Test Results & Findings

### Automated Test Capabilities

1. **Page Load Testing**
   - Measures load time for all critical pages
   - Detects blank/black screen issues
   - Captures console errors
   - Takes screenshots on failure

2. **OAuth Flow Validation**
   - Verifies Google sign-in button presence
   - Tests redirect to Google OAuth
   - Validates callback URL structure
   - Checks post-auth redirects

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - P99 latency tracking
   - Resource optimization checks
   - First Contentful Paint timing
   - Render-blocking resource detection

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Pricing Page Black Screen

```typescript
// Add error boundary to App.tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.error('React Error:', error, errorInfo);
    // Send to monitoring service
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <div>Something went wrong. Please refresh.</div>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### Fix 2: OAuth Middleware Bypass

```typescript
// Ensure OAuth routes bypass auth middleware
app.get('/api/auth/google',
  skipAuthMiddleware, // Add this
  (req, res, next) => {
    // OAuth logic
  }
);
```

### Fix 3: Trial Page Accessibility

```typescript
// Update trial-selection.tsx to always show content
const shouldShowContent = true; // Always show, don't depend on auth

// Only require auth when selecting a trial
if (!user && userClickedTrial) {
  redirect('/auth?return=/trial-selection');
}
```

## How to Run Tests

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test against local development
npm run test:local

# Test against production
npm run test:critical
```

### Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Critical flow tests only
npm run test:critical

# User journey tests
npm run test:journey

# Performance tests
npm run test:perf

# Full CI test suite
npm run test:ci
```

### CI/CD Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
1. Every push to main/staging branches
2. All pull requests
3. Before deployments (pre-deploy hook)
4. After deployments (smoke tests)

---

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
TEST_URL=https://myaimediamgr.onrender.com  # Target URL
HEADLESS=true                               # Run browsers headlessly
CONNECTIONS=10                               # Load test connections
DURATION=30                                  # Load test duration (seconds)

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Page Load Times**
   - Target: < 2s for initial load
   - Alert: > 4s load time

2. **OAuth Success Rate**
   - Target: > 95% successful authentications
   - Alert: < 90% success rate

3. **API Response Times**
   - Target: P99 < 500ms
   - Alert: P99 > 1000ms

4. **Error Rates**

   - Run `npm run test:critical` to diagnose current issues
   - Review test results in `test-reports/` directory
   - Check screenshots in `test-screenshots/` for visual issues

2. **Short-term Fixes**:
   - Implement error boundaries in React components
   - Add detailed logging to OAuth flow
   - Ensure CSS and JavaScript bundles load correctly
   - Fix routing issues preventing page display

3. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Set up continuous monitoring
   - Implement A/B testing for trial selection
   - Add feature flags for gradual rollouts
   - Create synthetic monitoring for critical paths

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests fail with timeout errors**
- Increase TEST_TIMEOUT in test files
- Check if target URL is accessible
- Verify network connectivity

**Puppeteer/Playwright won't start**
- Install browser dependencies: `npx playwright install-deps`
- Use headless mode: `HEADLESS=true npm test`

**False positives in black screen detection**
- Adjust wait times for React rendering
- Check for lazy-loaded components
- Verify CSS bundle is loaded before testing

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
DEBUG=* npm run test:critical

# Run with slow motion to see what's happening
SLOW_MO=250 HEADLESS=false npm run test:critical
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing suite provides:
- ✅ Automated detection of black screen issues
- ✅ OAuth flow validation and monitoring
- ✅ Performance baselines and regression detection
- ✅ CI/CD integration with deployment gates

The tests are production-ready and can be immediately deployed to diagnose and monitor the critical issues affecting user experience on MyAiMediaMgr.

**Deployment Quality Gates**: Tests ensure that no deployment proceeds if critical user flows are broken, protecting production stability.

**Recommended Priority**:
1. Fix pricing page black screen issue (High)
2. Validate OAuth flow redirects (High)
3. Ensure trial selection accessibility (Medium)
4. Optimize page load performance (Low)

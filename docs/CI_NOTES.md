CI status for PR #4

Summary
- Several GitHub Actions checks are failing due to a GitHub billing lock on the account. These failures are not related to the code changes in PR #4.
- One security scan (GitGuardian) passed successfully.
- Deploy and performance checks were skipped by the workflow because prerequisite jobs failed early due to the billing lock.

What this means
- Automated CI (Critical Flow Tests, User Journey Tests, Quality Gate Decision) cannot run until the billing issue is resolved on the GitHub account.
- Validation should be performed via:
  - Local build/typecheck: `npm ci && npm run build`
  - Manual verification on the Render environment (service srv-d33qf7umcj7s73ajfi7g): https://myaimediamgr.onrender.com

Next steps to re-enable CI
1) Resolve the GitHub billing lock on the repositoryâ€™s owner account.
2) Re-run the failed workflow or push a no-op commit to trigger the workflows.
3) Confirm that tests and gates complete successfully.

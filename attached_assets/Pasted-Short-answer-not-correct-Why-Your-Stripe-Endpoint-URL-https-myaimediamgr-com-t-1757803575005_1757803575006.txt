Short answer: not correct.

Why:

* Your Stripe **Endpoint URL = `https://myaimediamgr.com`** (the site root). Stripe doesn’t send webhooks to your homepage. It needs a **dedicated POST endpoint** that returns 2xx with no login.
* You’re in **Sandbox** and “Event deliveries = 0,” so nothing has reached your app yet. If your Replit deploy is/was private or your root redirects, Stripe can’t hit it anyway.
* I can see a **whsec\_…** signing secret on screen. Treat that like a password—keep it in env vars only.

Do this:

1. Make the site public (no Replit login wall). The webhook must be reachable by Stripe without auth.

2. Create a real webhook route and point Stripe to it, e.g.
   `https://myaimediamgr.com/api/stripe/webhook`

**Express example (production-safe skeleton):**

```js
import express from "express";
import Stripe from "stripe";

const app = express();
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

// IMPORTANT: raw body for signature verification (put BEFORE any json/bodyParser)
app.post("/api/stripe/webhook", express.raw({ type: "application/json" }), (req, res) => {
  const sig = req.headers["stripe-signature"];
  let event;
  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, sig, process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET);
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
  }

  // Handle the events you actually use
  switch (event.type) {
    case "checkout.session.completed":
      // fulfill order or activate subscription
      break;
    case "invoice.paid":
    case "invoice.payment_failed":
    case "customer.subscription.updated":
    case "customer.subscription.deleted":
      break;
    default:
      // log unexpected events
  }

  // Ack fast; do heavy work async
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

// AFTER the webhook route:
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```

3. In the Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks:

* **Endpoint URL:** `https://myaimediamgr.com/api/stripe/webhook`
* **API version:** match your Stripe SDK version (pin it; don’t leave a future version that your code doesn’t expect).
* **Events to listen to (minimum viable):**
  `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`,
  `customer.subscription.created|updated|deleted`
* Copy the **Signing secret** to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (env var in Replit). Never paste it in code.

4. Test it:

* Click **Send test events** → expect **2xx** in “Event deliveries.”
* If you see 4xx/5xx, open your server logs. Common gotchas: wrong path, JSON body parser placed **before** the webhook (breaks signature), or a redirect (Stripe does not follow 301/302).

5. Go live:

* Repeat the setup in **Live mode** (new live signing secret). Keep test and live endpoints separate.

Extra sanity checks:

* If your app is a static front-end, you still need a **server** to receive webhooks (Replit “Web Server”/Reserved VM). Webhooks can’t hit a pure static site.
* No auth, no CAPTCHA, no Google login on the webhook path.
* Return 200 quickly and do the real work off-thread/queued.

Do those and your Stripe page will start showing successful deliveries instead of a pretty graph of nothing. If you want me to eyeball your Replit env vars and the exact route code, drop them (minus secrets) and I’ll tighten the bolts.
